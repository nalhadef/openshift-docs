= Introduction to selecting and deploying OCP models

{product-title} (OCP) is a platform for developing and running containerized
applications. By recognizing the various constraints and OCP models, you can simplify the deployment process while placing greater focus on your system needs. 

There are three constraints to be mindful of:
* Physical constraints
* Social constraints
* Economic constraints

Each OCP deployment model is impacted by all three constraints. As you apply your resources to one of the constraints, there are less resources to apply to the others. For best results, be aware of the relative importance of each constraint to your system and its deployment.

Physical constraints include:
* The number of location involved
* The number of computers per location
* Instance types
* Resiliency (network, power)
* Latency (network, storage)

Social constraints include:
* Trust (domain security)
* Risk (blast radius)
* Schedule (Windows maintenance)
* Structural responsibility
** Cloud
** Network
** Platform
** Application

Economic constraints include:
* The cost of infrastuctures
* Cost of expertise
* Proximity of location (cost of travel to locations)
* Impact of loss




It is designed to allow applications and the data centers
that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to
thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, {product-title} incorporates the same
technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming
video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open
Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a
single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

// The architecture presented here is meant to give you insights into how {product-title} works. It does this by stepping you through the process of installing an {product-title} cluster, managing the cluster, and developing and deploying applications on it. Along the way, this architecture describes:

// * Major components of  {product-title}
// * Ways of exploring different aspects of {product-title} yourself
// * Available frontdoors (and backdoors) to modify the installation and management of your {product-title} cluster
// * Different types of container application types
