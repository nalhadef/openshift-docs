toc::[]

You can add more compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on VMware vSphere manually.

[NOTE]
====
You can also xref:../../machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-vsphere.adoc#creating-machineset-vsphere[use compute machine sets] to automate the creation of additional VMware vSphere compute machines for your cluster.
====

== Prerequisites

* You xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/upi/installing-vsphere.adoc#installing-vsphere[installed a cluster on vSphere].

* You have installation media and {op-system-first} images that you used to create your cluster. If you do not have these files, you must obtain them by following the instructions in the xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/upi/installing-vsphere.adoc#installing-vsphere[installation procedure].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not have access to the {op-system-first} images that were used to create your cluster, you can add more compute machines to your {product-title} cluster with newer versions of {op-system-first} images. For instructions, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5514051[Adding new nodes to UPI cluster fails after upgrading to OpenShift 4.6+].

== Creating {op-system-first} machines on a vSphere infrastructure

Before you add more compute machines to a cluster that you installed on a vSphere infrastructure, you must create {op-system} machines for it to use. You can either use an ISO image or network PXE booting to create the machines.

[NOTE]
====
You must use the same ISO image that you used to install a cluster to deploy all new nodes in a cluster. Use the same Ignition config file. The nodes automatically upgrade themselves on the first boot before running the workloads. You can add the nodes before or after the upgrade.
